Submission of the backend task for the second round interview

## Project Outline

### What the project does
This is the backend of a web app that processes provided data about tick sightings in the UK. Data can be filtered by city and date. Furthermore, both weekly and monthly trends for all of the data can be seen easily through the created app routes.

### Why the project is useful
This app allows for the quick processing of tick sighting data dating back over a decade ago. This means that the app can both help keep track of old records and very clearly view the change in the amount of tick sightings over the year. This makes studying the data significantly easier as it takes far less time to go through it all to find the specific parts you might ahve been looking for.
